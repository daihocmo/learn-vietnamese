In this "Vietnamese Reading" guide, I will show you how to read Vietnamese books using `ttsu-reader` and `yomitan` to look up words directly.

First, please visit [ttsu-reader](https://reader.ttsu.app/) website. This website is originally created for Japanese learners but we can also use it for reading any kinds of ebooks, Vietnamese e-books too!.

Here is how it looks like when you visit it the first time.

After importing the file(s), the book(s) will be displayed on the dashboard, click on the book to read it.
