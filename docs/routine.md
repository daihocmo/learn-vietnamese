# 30 Day Vietnamese (UsagiSpoon)
_Note: haven't done editing the whole guide yet._

Usagispoon but with some modifications.

A guide/routine to help people learn Vietnamese from scratch with the immersion method.  

This guide was made to be followed in order. Most of the decisions have already been made for you.   

The routines are split into days. Each day has tasks that you need to do.  

What you'll expect to know at the end of the 30 days:

- An understanding of the most common Vietnamese grammar patterns
- A vocabulary of at least 500 words.  
- An understanding of basic sentences in movies.  
- A good foundation to continue learning Vietnamese on your own.  

What I expect from you: 

- **the will to learn**    
- 2+ hours of your free time per day available for Vietnamese.  
- a computer (sorry phone users)  

## Day 1  

### Stage: alphabet stage  
The absolute first thing you need to do when you learn Vietnamese is to learn the alphabet (which it's pretty easy since it uses the Latin script like English).

Watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vywmh8V_5h0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vywmh8V_5h0)  

Now, vist [this website](https://quizlet.com/vn/233838209/the-vietnamese-alphabet-chu-cai-tieng-viet-flash-cards/). This is a Quizlet link to help you revise the alphabet, the pronunciation at the back of a card is written in Vietnamese, represents exactly how it sounds, without relying on dumb IPA or corressponding english sounds like "ah, oh, ehh". 

Most of Vietnamese dictionaries out there don't have word audio, so you may wanna use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=vi&tl=en&text=%0A%0A&op=translate).

## Day 2  

### Stage: Creating your own Vietnam at home  

Surrounding your daily life with Vietnamese is the most important part of the immersion method. 

It may be hard to decide, but you'll need to find content that interests you and you'll need to make consuming it a habit.  

Slice of life movie is a good place to start.  

Here are some suggestions (but you can use anything you want):  

**Q: Everything here is so boooooring!!!! I'd rather watch something actually good!**

A: And I like your way of thinking! Immersion is all about spending time with content that interests you. So please, don't limit yourself to my suggestions.  

**Your task:**  

I want you to try immersing for the first time with the "subtitle tutor" method.  

The subtitle tutor method is where you watch an episode of an with English subtitles, then watch it again without subtitles. Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier).  

The flowchart process:

1. Watch with English subtitles  
2. Watch without any subtitles (also known as raw listening)  
3. Are you done for today? 
    - Yes = Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things.
    - No = Go back to step 1.

Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input.  

While watching the episode raw, don't worry if you can't understand.  

Try to focus on the sounds, the speaking patterns and anything in it that you can make meaning out of.  

Becoming able to understand Vietnamese is a skill that takes a long time.  

But it all begins with raw listening and trying to make that listening comprehensible.  

The subtitle tutor method is only meant to provide context for the audio you are listening to.   

You can try listening to the audio when doing other things.  

By doing that you are essentially filling in the silence with Vietnamese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said.  

Note: Listening while doing other things = **passive immersion**.  
Listening with undivided attention = **active immersion**.  

**Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study?** 

A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of their environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Vietnamese and get a deeper feel for the language.  

**Q: So, I've completed my first episode, what should I do now?**

A: You can consider your immersion done for the day but if you want to do more (which is great) then you can roll a dice to decide how many episodes you want to watch.  

[Roll a dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)   

I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow.  

## Day 3

### Stage: Just starting grammar 

Now here's where you'll start grammar.  

You don't need to do any drills or anything.    

You don't need to choose the correct patterns or anything like that.   

Everything you will be learning is insanely common and will be reinforced with your daily immersion.     

The grammar guide I want you to use is [seahorse viet grammar's archive](https://seahorseviet.wordpress.com/category/grammar/)

All I want you to do is **watch the videos** and **take notes**

(Google Keep note taking site here: [https://keep.google.com/](https://keep.google.com/))  

***Take notes.***  

**Q: What should I even put in my notes?**  

A: You should put information that you feel is important.  

Rely on your instincts.  

If they say this means that, then you might want to take a note of it.  

Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone.  

Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes.  

**Q: Why should I even do notes! I can probably remember everything anyway!**

A: I want you to take notes so you can go over them whenever you need to. (Keyword: when **you** need to!)  

You are essentially making your own little mini version of the videos in your notes.  

So, if you *do* forget something, you can always just look at your notes.  

**Q: I really don't want to take notes...**  
A: And that is fine!  

Note-taking is an area where I do think personal preference is involved.  

### Stage: Just done your first grammar lessons

After you watched your first 3 Cure Dolly videos, you can consider that your **"grammar session done for the day".**  

Now what I want you to do is immerse.  

You know the drill.  

[Roll a 4-sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)   

**Q: Do I need to do the "subtitle tutor" method?**  

A: The subtitle tutor method is **not required**. It is merely a way to make immersion more interesting in the beginning. 

I merely presented it to you as a method that is available to you.  

**Q: What do I do if I keep hearing a word that interests me and want to know what it means?**

A: First of all, that's great!  
You can use [tratu.coviet.vn](https://tratu.coviet.vn/hoc-tieng-anh/tu-dien/lac-viet/V-A/-all.html) to search up the word. 
There's a chance you might be mishearing it so you may not be able to find out.  

Tomorrow will get more complex. So, uh, look forward to it...?  

## Day 4  

### Stage: Learning new words: Using Anki for the first time.  

Today you'll be:  

- Practicing alphabet  
- Studying grammar  
- Using Anki for the first time
- Learning new words in Anki. 
- Setting up a Vietnamese keyboard on your pc 
- Doing your daily immersion.  

It is a lot. Please make sure you have enough time today.   

After that, do your daily grammar study.  

After you've done that, let's set up Anki.  

First, I want you to watch this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUITtA1jJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUITtA1jJI)  

Now let's download Anki.  

You can download Anki by visiting the official website ([here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)) and clicking on the Download button. It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option.  

Download the he [Basic Vietnamese for English Speakers](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/285983903).

When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the "interface language selector". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine.  

Go into **Tools** on the top bar, and click **Preferences (Ctrl+P)**.  

In this window, click on the **Scheduling** tab, and check (âœ“) the option "*V3 Scheduler*".  

And change the **Learn ahead limit** to `900`.  

Now click Close.  

In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button **Import File** is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck. 
Once clicked, it should open the file picker window.   

Choose your downloaded deck.  

When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok.  

Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it.  

The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day.  

20 cards is the default.  

20 cards may or not be manageable.  

You might want to lower the number of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now.   

Click the cog icon next to the *Kaishi 1.5k* deck.  

Click *Options*.  

Change **Maximum reviews/day** to `9999`. This just means "uncapped".  

The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki every day but,  

It is good practice to uncap your review limit.  

Just some Anki know-how.  

You also need to change the **Learning steps** to `1m 5m 10m`.  

Change **Insertion order**, to **Sequential (oldest cards first)**  

Under the **Lapses** section, change the *Relearning Steps* to `10m`.  

Under the **Display Order** section, change the *New/review order* to **Show before reviews**.  

Now click *Save*.  

I also want you to install the *Speed Focus Mode* Anki add-on. I will explain why later, but let's just install it now.  

Click on *Tools* at the top of Anki, and click *Add-ons*.  

Click **Get Add-ons...**.   

Paste this code into the box: `1046608507` and click **OK**.

You need to restart Anki. Close Anki, and launch it back up.  

Click the cog icon next to the *Kaishi 1.5k* deck.  

Hold the ++shift++ key and click *Options*.  

A different looking menu with some red text should open. (If it did not, you did it wrong. You need to hold ++shift++ while clicking *Options*).  

In the *General* tab, there are a few settings you need to change.  

Change *Automatically play alert* to `15` seconds.  

Change *Automatically show answer* to `30` seconds.  

Change *Automatically rate 'again'* to `180` seconds.  

Now let's get to studying the deck.  

When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking *Study now*  

If you click "Show answer", it reveals the *back* of the card, and you will be able to find out how to read the word on the front.  

The deck has other features, such as word meaning, audio, sentence and translations.  

BUT the only things you should be memorising is the **word on the front**, **reading** and **word meaning**.

Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else.  

Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. 

In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself.   

Think of **Again** as "I GOT IT WRONG". **Easy** as SUPER EASY, **Good** as normal/usual/eh, and **Hard** as "I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right".  

Because this is a card that is **seen for the first time**, press "Again".  

When seeing "unseen cards" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing **Again**.  

This will send the card to the "Learning" pile. 

You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1?  

The red number is the learning pile.  

Blue: New pile  
Red: Learning pile  
Green: Review pile  

The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. 

Getting a "Good" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in *x* number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards).  

When the learning pile (red number) goes down that means the card has graduated.  

**Do not spend a long time looking at the same card**  

When you don't know the word even after 15 seconds of looking at it, then looking at it for even longer doesn't mean you'll suddenly remember it.  

So, the purpose of the *Speed Focus Mode* add-on is to stop you from spending too much time on one card.  

**My card learning method**  

Step 1: Look at the card.  
Step 2: Recognize whether it is a new card or not.  
Step 3: Reveal the back (Show answer) after realizing it is a new card.  
Step 4: Read the reading.  
Step 5: Read the meaning.  
Step 6: Let the audio play.  
Step 7: For now, press "Again"  
Step 8: Above 7 steps will be the same if the next card is also a new card but...  
Step 9: If the next card is one I've already seen before, I test my knowledge.  
Step 10: I try to recall the word's meaning and the reading.  
Step 11: There are sometimes more than 1 meaning. Only 1 meaning is enough.  
Step 12: I reveal the back.  
Step 13: I grade myself depending on if the meaning *and* reading I thought it was, was correct.  
Step 14: I usually use the Good button if I got it correct. Again if it wasn't correct.  

After you have successfully learned 20 cards, you can consider your Anki done for the day.  

The next day you can expect to see some cards in the green (Review) pile. 

You will also have a fresh batch of 20 new cards!  

Please make sure you do Anki every day!   

**Q: Should I worry if I forget a lot?**  

A: No.  

Anki is made for things you're likely to forget.  

You are very likely to forget words of a language you just started learning.  

I don't think it is strange if you forget more than half of what you learn when a day passes by.  

You're likely to forget these words without Anki, so that's why you need to keep Anki'ing them so you can finally learn the word.  

In other words, just keep doing Anki.  

If this continues for a while then you might want to think back on your method of doing Anki.   

**Q: Leeches (Words not sticking)**  

Leeches are when you keep forgetting the word no matter what.  

Memory works by picking up on cues.  

When words don't stick, it means there are multiple things in the wider scope of the word that makes it so your mind isn't picking on any cues. 

In easier terms, you need more, or different information than the information on the card.  

For these leeches, I recommend looking at them in example sentences. You can use [tratu.coviet.vn](https://tratu.coviet.vn/hoc-tieng-anh/tu-dien/lac-viet/V-A/-all.html) to see example sentences with an English translation.  

**Setting up a Vietnamese Keyboard**  

Now let's set up a Vietnamese keyboard. 

Read this article: [How to type Vietnamese on Computers](https://vietnameseguru.com/2022/02/how-to-type-vietnamese-on-computer/)  

Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion.  

I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing.  

I recommend you decide on a set number of episodes to use for immersion per day.  If you can't decide, then by all means, let a dice decide for you! [Roll a 4-sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)   

## Day 5  

Practice the alphabet do your daily Anki. Anki is tough in the beginning. But it gets better I promise!  

Your Anki today will be slightly different. You'll have a blue number AND a green number next to the deck.  

The **green** number is your **reviews**.  

Make sure you stay on top of your reviews!  

Important word of advice: If you ever become unable to keep up with piling reviews, then reduce your new cards per day limit!  

After you've done your Anki for the day, you should get onto your daily grammar study.  

After that, it's just your daily immersion.  

**Q: How many episodes will it be???**  

A: [Roll a 4-sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)   

**Q: What should I be looking out for when listening?**

A: The sounds of it, the speaking patterns, the "words" that pop up a lot, the words that you learned, the grammar that you learned etc.  

Every little bit counts.  

## Day 6  

### Stage: First ever reading practice: Vietnamese simple text. 

Today you'll start reading practice for the first time!  

It is going to be quite tough.  

But don't worry if you don't understand it!  

Every bit counts!  

First, practice alphabet. After that, go on to doing your Anki. After your Anki, do your daily grammar lessons.  

Then let's get on to reading. First, you will need Yomichan. Click on this [link](yomitan.md) to read my guide on it.  

By using ++shift++ on a word, Yomichan should pop up with a dictionary definition. 

So, what's the routine? 

Read anything you want, really, or just try reading something simple like [easy vietnamese](http://easyvietnamese.weebly.com/reading)

**Q: How many words do I look up?**  

A: I think you should decide this using a 20-sided dice, per episode.  

[Click here for 20-sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+20+sided+dice)  

Roll!  

After you've looked up your amount just *read* the rest.

**Q: Is it possible to understand everything by spending 10 minutes spamming Yomichan on a sentence?**  

A: Short answer: No. Comprehension is a gradual process.  

Long answer:  

There are many things you will not understand just by using a dictionary.  

There are many factors that go into understanding something.  

There are obvious factors such as vocabulary and grammar.

But there are also less obvious ones such as the contexts that that piece of language is often used in, which in turns leads to its meaning.  

In a vacuum, studying vocabulary and grammar increases your ability to understand things.  

But understanding the use of the vocabulary and grammar in contexts further increases your understanding of the sentence.  

This works especially well for sentences that have only one piece of language that you aren't comfortable with.  

This doesn't work well for hard sentences though.  

Because there is too much language information in the sentence that you are too unfamiliar with.  

The best you can do for hard sentences is to look up the vocabulary in them.  

While it may not be enough to understand *that* sentence at *that* time, your newly found knowledge of the word can help you connect it to some meaning in a later context.  

With more study and immersion (understanding things in context), your understanding of Vietnamese will increase.  

**Q: How can I expect to remember the words I look up?**  

A: Great question! It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember.  

In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now.  

Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time.  

What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like "Oh, right!". And move on.  

**Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Vietnamese has no spaces!**  

A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner.  

You get better at it over time.  

Language learning is just pattern recognition after all.  

Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy.  

**Q: Now that I can see the Vietnamese, can I try to translate it in my head?**  

A: It's complicated...   

There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Vietnamese.  

The way of thinking is a lot different.  

That is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tends to advise against trying to translate your immersion.  

Because Vietnamese is not English.  

You are advised to think of Vietnamese as Vietnamese.  

Be the language!  

You can do some sort of "loose translation", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning.  

*Do I need to translate at all?*  

Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (Missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning that's hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.)  

It is also tiring, so do it in moderation.  

**Q: Should I watch Vietnamese subs or raw?**  

A: They exist for different purposes.  

I can't say which one is better because they have their own benefits and drawbacks.  

Vietnamese subs: 
Good: learn new words, reading practice  
Bad: doesn't train raw listening ability, you might not pick up on things said in the audio  

Raw:  
Good: trains raw listening ability and can attribute to speaking ability too. You will notice more than just watching with Vietnamese subtitles.  
Bad: the words you dont know you just don't know.  

**Q: What about subtitle tutor?**  

A: You shouldn't be doing it all the time.  

The only purpose is to give you an idea; context of what the audio is saying.  

It gets tedious watching the same episode twice too.

Without watching the episode in Vietnamese after you watch it in English, there is no point.  

And using English subs as a crutch forever isn't a good idea.  

It just makes your immersion more effective in the beginning because immersion works better **when you have an idea of what is going on**.  

Getting rid of translations and training yourself to understand the language on its own is how you'll get better at Vietnamese in the future.  

## Day 7  

**Note about alphabet practice:**  

Experience differs greatly from person to person. 

Some of you may already be comfortable with the alphabet after just 6 days.  

Others may need more practice.  

I think you should reduce the time spent on alphabet practice from **10 minutes** to **5 minutes**.  

You will be exposed to Vietnamese text a lot more going forward.  

### Stage: Learning how to balance as a beginner.    

Your tasks for today are as follows.  

Step 1. Do your Anki.  
Step 2. Grammar.  
Step 3. Immerse!! (Details below)  

Focusing on a particular area of your Vietnamese (e.g., listening or reading) is good.  

But how will you decide whether today is a day where you'll focus on listening or reading?  

For an advanced learner that can already read books and understand a lot of things, this is more obvious.  

But for a beginner, it can be tough to decide.  

The simple answer?  

[Flip a coin](https://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin).  

Heads = Listening day  
Tails = Reading day  

## Day 8

**Q: So, what do I need to do today?**

1. Anki.  
2. Grammar.
3. Immersion.  

**Q: Immersion...?**

Yes, you can do reading/watch with Vietnamese subs/raw listening/subtitle tutor.  

You can decide everything with a dice and flipping a coin if you're uncertain, of course.  

I apologize if "immersion" is a vague term.  

All of that stuff that you did with the video/audio/podcast and Yomitan is immersion.  

## Day 9  

### Stage: Repetition starts to settle in  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

This is the fundamental process of the method. Keep doing what you're doing.  

But longer hours = more improvement!  
So, try and aim for longer immersion hours!  

**Q: I've been thinking about looking up a lot of words in reading, is this bad or good?**

A: It's good! But please note if you make yourself look up a ton of words all the time, there is a risk of **burning out** and loss of enjoyment. 

This method relies on **your consistency**.  

To stay consistent, you need to make sure you're setting yourself manageable goals.  

## Day 10  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

You may want to look into Condensed Audio, this is a way to maximize the efficiency of passive listening.  

Passive listening is when you listen to Vietnamese audio when you are doing other things.  

While passive listening there are moments where you may be paying attention to the Vietnamese.  

Think of it as filling in the silence with Vietnamese.  

Or, listening to Vietnamese at every possible opportunity. 

Condensed audio removes non-speech parts of the audio, making it more efficient.  

If you have wireless earbuds, listening all the time becomes a lot easier.  

## Day 11  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  


**Q: MUST I do all my daily tasks in this exact order you have written?**  

A: Nononono! Absolutely not.  

You can even do immersion first thing, or grammar first thing, or even Anki right at the end of the day. This is an area where people just have preferences and things that work better for them.  

**Note: Just make sure you don't miss Anki!**  

## Day 12  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

Yes, another day of immersing. Maybe day 12 can be *Non-Non Biyori* day. (Unless you've already immersed with it :P)     

**Q: Can I listen to the same things over and over again?**  

A: Absolutely! But if it gets boring, then switch to new content.  

Listening to the same content has huge benefits, but it can get boring and also you miss opportunities to hear new, useful things.   

## Day 13  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

Here's an interesting challenge for you today.  

Let today be a reading practice day.  

Look up **25** words in your Vietnamese reading practice.  

## Day 14

Congratulations on making it this far!  

I know it has been tough (especially Anki and reading!), but the beginner stage is always the hardest part of learning any language, and things will only get easier the longer you do it.  

With more time spent doing the right methods, you'll certainly improve.  

You may have your doubts on what this method is actually doing, so allow me to explain.  

Your **Anki**, **grammar study** and **looking up words** is where you are increasing your *knowledge* of the language.  

Your **listening** and **reading** practice are where you are **applying** your *knowledge*, by getting exposure to how these parts of the language are used by natives.  

The **subtitle tutor method** aims to boost the **comprehensibility** of your **listening immersion** by giving you context of what is being said in the audio.  

Your **Vietnamese subtitle listening** helps you: associate alphabet with sounds, figure out what words are being said and ease you into reading.  

Your **raw (no subs) listening practice** is where you build a mental model of how the language actually sounds. This is good for a number of reasons. The main reasons being getting a good accent, and also being able to hear the words that you know. Listening isn't as clear as reading, it can be very fast and hard to keep up with. By getting used to raw listening you can train yourself to hear these unclear things better.  

When you get advanced at Vietnamese and understand your raw listening immersion, mass raw listening is the only way to get fluent.  

Your **passive listening** fills in the gaps where you otherwise wouldn't be doing Vietnamese.  

### Stage: 200-page Doraemon challenge  

From today until the 30th day. I want you to challenge yourself to read 100 pages of the Doraemonmanga.  

Doraemon is a great slice of life manga that has been translated into many languages, including Vietnamese.

Manga are tricky to look up words on because they are essentially, text on images. But you can just type out words and look them up using Yomitan (typing vietnamese if fairly easy). 

You can download the manga [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/D7397KHVJC#FOvauRhcv724).

**Q: So, what will I need to be doing from today until the 30th day?**  

As always you will need to do your Anki and grammar study.  

Your immersion will get more... complicated.  

You will need to balance reading that manga and your usual immersion.  

Shoving everything into the same day may be too difficult.  

**Word looking up trick: The Yomichan Search Page**  

You can use Yomichan to search up words by typing it or copy and pasting it.  

You will need to use the Yomichan search page to look up words from my Yotsubato Reading Helper.  

You can access the search page by clicking on the Yomichan icon in your browser extensions toolbar, and then clicking the magnifying glass icon. Or by pressing ++alt++++insert++  

**Q: How long will it actually take to read 100 pages?**

A: At a pace of 10 minutes per page, it will take 16 hours and 40 minutes.  

If you read it for 1 hour every day for the rest of the 30 days, you can finish it in time.  

This is assuming your pace stays at 10 minutes per page though!  

Your pace can increase the more you get used to reading Yotsubato.  

**Q: Am I looking up every word in the manga or am I using a dice to decide?**  

A: I want you to look up as much as you can.  

**Q: I don't understand the sentences!**  

Don't worry if you don't understand sentences.  

You don't understand them because they aren't i+1.  (Only 1 component of the sentence that you aren't already quite comfortable with)

With more reading, more i+1 opportunities arise.  

And when you read, look up, and understand i+1 sentences, your Vietnamese comprehension level increases.  

And with enough reading, you'll be able to go back to those difficult sentences and understand them at least a little better.  
In other words, you'll only learn to understand sentences with more reading!!!   

### Important! Learning how to read for long hours and making it enjoyable.  

#### Timeboxing

**Pomodoro**  

The Pomodoro timer method is where you focus on a task for a set time (usually 25 minutes) until the timer rings, then you take a break for 5 minutes. When your 5 minutes are up, you go back to focusing.  

Use this Pomodoro timer: [https://pomofocus.io/](https://pomofocus.io/)    

You should reduce the time to 15 minutes if 25 minutes is too long.  

**20-sided dice**

For anyone that isn't feeling like reading for too long on a particular day, you can roll a 20-sided dice to decide how many minutes you're gonna read.  

[Roll a 20-sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+20+sided+dice)  

Or you could use the 20-sided dice to decide how many minutes reading you're gonna do between any series' episodes!  

#### Skimming/Skipping  

Reading isn't about reading all of the text in the book.  

You need to learn how to skip and skim things that don't interest you/annoy you etc.  

If that annoying part of the book was any good then it would make you wanna read it right?  

You can always go back to that one annoying part after you've read the good bits after all.  

If you want to, of course.  

#### Take breaks!  

Take breaks if you feel tired/fatigued!  

## Day 15 to Day 30: Daily Vietnamese Study and Immersion

Until the 30th day, all I want you to do is:

- Anki
- your grammar study
- "Immersion" = (reading that manga, movies, tv shows, subtitle tutor, passive listening or anything you like)

The method is pretty much that.  

You will be doing the same thing for the next few weeks.  

Keep up with it.  

You're doing great!  

**Q: During this period can I read and watch other things that you haven't talked about?**  

Of course!  

Read what interests you!  

Watch what interests you!  

This study guide (UsagiSpoon) was just making a few of the decisions for you.  

**Q: What is the ideal UsagiSpoon lifesyle?**  

A: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Qxr8OGkaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Qxr8OGkaA)  

## Day 31 and beyond: After UsagiSpoon?  

At this point, you will have enough of a foundation to proceed with learning on your own.  

There are a few "Vietnamese learning tasks" I'd like to set you.  

There is no time limit for these tasks.  

Some you might not even be able to do until months or years down the line!  

Nevertheless, I highly recommend you do them.  

- Finish the he [Basic Vietnamese for English Speakers](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/285983903)
- Do the [Vietnamese Pronunciation Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1747674390) deck.  
- Finish duykhanh471's grammar guide  
- Study all the Vietnamese grammar from the [Dictionary of Vietnamese Grammar](). There are about 220 grammar points (working in progress).     
- Start reading longer texts such as novels. Participate in TheMoeWay Discord's novel club to hang out with other people doing the same.  
- Train your ability to recognize and read Vietnamese numbers, with this resource: [Practice Vietnamese Numbers](https://langpractice.com/vietnamese).   
- Start a "mining" Anki deck sometime after you finish the Banhcuon1.5k deck.  
- Try using a monolingual dictionary after you finish a novel.  
- Increase your immersion hours.
