I have no idea how should I sort these books, so here is the approximate difficulty, based on my own reading experiences. 

You should read these Vietnamese books using an [online ebook reader](https://reader.ttsu.app) (to look up words immediately using Yomitan) or using ebook reader like Kindle or Kobo. Check out [the guide here](reading-guide.md).

| Ba Lần và Một Lần | Chu Lai | Medium | My first book and one that will be with me until I'm 6 feet deep underground. A story of betrayal, friendship, cruelty and love. I will not say anything about the story because it's just so good, I like to keep the story fresh because it's such experience when you read it for the first time (u/Front_Association998) | |
| Chí Phèo | Nam Cao | Medium | The story is about the life of Chí Phèo (the main protagonist). Not the entirety but his last days. Think of Chí Phèo as a drunken bastard, he's cruel, inhuman as has no capacity for love and empathy. He works for this guy name cụ Bá Kiến, a local landlord who seems like a kind person but is actually a piece of shit. He let Chí Phèo do the dirty work for him so he can keep his image. On his last days, he met Thị Nở, a woman who is infamous for her rather ugly appearance, and well they fell in love and for once in his life again, he felt love, he sees the road that has chosen and hated it. And the ending is near but I don't want to spoil it, a must read. (u/Front_Association998)| |
| Sống mòn | Nam Cao | Medium | the story of a poor teacher (It has been a while so I forgot his name) who's unlike everyone else, realise that he's not living, he's just living through the day, paycheck after paycheck to survive and provide for his family. He's living like a mindless machine, just works through the day, blinded by the present so he can't see the future. He can't see his purpose, he wants to live for a bigger, meaningful goal but he can't escape the cruel machine of life. His realisation is only enough for him to know it, not escape it. Absolutely brilliant and it doubles as a life advice. (u/Front_Association998) | |
| Sông Xa | Chu Lai | Medium | Is there really a boundary good and bad? There still resides evil within good and there's still good with evil. | |
