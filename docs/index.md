## An optimized approach to learning Vietnamese

### What is this website about?

This website explains a general input-driven immersion-based language learning method with special focus on Vietnamese. 

Immersion-based learning is deceptively simple and has its roots, at least in the Japanese learning community, in [this famous blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20230604042706/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog). In there, the author realized that by immersing himself constantly in Japanese, he was able to understand the language much faster than by spending time solving grammar exercises in a textbook.

### Why don't write your own guide?
Uh I'm lazy and their (shoui and donkuri) guides are great for learners and I don't find it worth rewriting the whole guide (I'll try to improve/rewrite the guide (I'm doing it now) so that it fits Vietnamese learners better).
