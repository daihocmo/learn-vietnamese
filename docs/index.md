## An optimized approach to learning Vietnamese

Welcome to **How to learn Vietnamese**, a website made for Vietnamese learners and people interested in language learning more generally.

Most of the guides and ideas here were taken (~~stolen~~) from [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and [Donkuri's site](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/) with slight modifications, please visit their site if you wanna learn Japanese or just bcuz I'm guilty of copying their posts. This site is simply just a copycat. 

You should read their sites about how they learn Japanese, which can be applied to learning Vietnamese (or to basically every languages on the Earth).
