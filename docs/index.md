## An optimized approach to learning Japanese

Welcome to Immersion-Based Vietnamese Learning, a website made for Vietnamese learners and people interested in language learning more generally.

Most of the posts and guides here were taken (~~stolen~~) from [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and [Donkuri's site](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/), please visit their site if you wanna learn Japanese or just bcuz I'm guilty of copying their posts. This site is simply just a copycat.

### What is this website?

This website explains a general input-driven immersion-based language learning method with special focus on Vietnamese. Immersion-based learning is deceptively simple and has its roots, at least in the Japanese learning community, in [this famous blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20230604042706/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog). In there, the author realized that by immersing himself constantly in Japanese, he was able to understand the language much faster than by spending time solving grammar exercises in a textbook.


My goal in building this website is threefold:

1.  To explain and argue for immersion-based language learning;
2.  To give you an actual learning setup you can use for Vietnamese;
3.  To list learning resources and Vietnamese media recommendations.

If all of this sounds good to you, [click here to read the guide.](guide.md)
