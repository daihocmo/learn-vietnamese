## An optimized approach to learning Vietnamese

Welcome to **How to learn Vietnamese**, a website made for Vietnamese learners and people interested in language learning more generally.

Most of the guides and ideas here were taken (~~stolen~~) from [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and [Donkuri's site](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/) with slight modifications, please visit their site if you want to learn Japanese. This site is simply just a copycat version of their sites.
