I don't wanna create _yet another vietnamese language learning server_ so here are some suggestions:
 
- [immerse in trees](https://discord.gg/jJjaCH3Bc2)
- [TheMoeWay's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nhqjydaR8j) - Originally made for Japanese learners but there's a channel for Vietnamese learners. Recommened if you follow the learning approach described in this site.
- [Vietnamese Learning Group](https://discord.com/invite/qdkn3Wqgaf)
- [Vietnamese English Muong Studies](https://discord.gg/FSntTjy)
