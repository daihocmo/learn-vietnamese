Sentence mining is a process of extracting sentences that contain unknown words from the content you read, watch or listen to in your target language and (usually) adding them to Anki.

1. You should read [this post](https://www.antimoon.com/how/examplesent.htm) on the Antimoon website about example sentences.

TL;DR:

> In an English dictionary, example sentences are even more important than definitions. A definition does one job: it tells you what a word means. Example sentences, on the other hand, perform at least three tasks:

> - They let you check if you’ve understood the definition correctly.
> - They show you how to use a word in sentences — how to connect it with other words and with grammar structures.
> - They program your brain to produce correct English sentences.

That's how important example sentences are. Sentence Mining here basically means you find example sentences from the things you watch, listen, read in your target language (Here is Vietnamese).
