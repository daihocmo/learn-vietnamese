## Mining Vietnamese sentences using Asbplayer

You have to install Asbplayer Browser Extension on your Browser (Chrome or Chrome/Chromium-based only, it doesn't support Firefox). You can download it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/asbplayer-language-learni/hkledmpjpaehamkiehglnbelcpdflcab)

First, open the Extension by clicking on the "asbplayer" inside the Extension list here.

Click "Load Subtitles".

It will ask you to choose the subtitle(s), most of the Vietnamese videos have auto-generated subtitles, you can choose that (It's pretty accurate tbh). 

Now you can look up words right inside Youtube
