I'm not really into creating _yet another vietnamese language learning server_. This language doesn't have that much learners but there're still people who want to learn, acquire the language so here are some suggestions:
 
- [**TheMoeWay's Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/nhqjydaR8j) - Originally made for Japanese learners but there's a channel for Vietnamese learners. Recommened if you follow the learning approach described in this site.
- [Vietnamese Learning Group](https://discord.com/invite/qdkn3Wqgaf)
- [Vietnamese English Muong Studies](https://discord.gg/FSntTjy)
