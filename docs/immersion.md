I'm too lazy to write a proper guide on immersion so here we go:

- [Thoughts on immersion and learning as a whole - Donkuri](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/immersion/) - a great starter point.
- [Antimoon- Input](https://www.antimoon.com/how/input.htm) - focus on english learning but its approach is invaluable and timeless and can be applied to Vietnamese.
