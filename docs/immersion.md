# Immersion in Vietnamese

In the **Main Guide**, I've written about Immersion and a quick guide to it. 

> Quality Vietnamese language learning content and resources are scarce. Compared to having studied the likes of Japanese, German, Spanish, Norwegian, and Hindi, this one is far from easy to find comprehensive, immersion-based content.

It's not _that hard_ to find Vietnamese immersion-based content. I've made the [Vietnamese Media Recommendation Spreadsheet](https://daihocmo.github.io/awesome-ngon-ngu/media-recs/tieng-viet/) and [A collection of Vietnamese Youtube channels](https://daihocmo.github.io/awesome-ngon-ngu/media-recs/tieng-viet/noi-dung-tieng-viet.html) to help you out.


### Immersion gets easier over time

Your first reading material is going to suck. You will spend a lot of time on basic grammar patterns. Almost every single sentence you will encounter will have one or multiple new words. This is normal. The key is to trust the process: **The more you read, the easier it becomes**. The same goes for other things (e.g: movies, youtube videos .etc.)

### Choosing immersion materials

As said previously, **just pick whatever you want** or use the [Vietnamese Media Recommendation Spreadsheet](https://daihocmo.github.io/awesome-ngon-ngu/media-recs/tieng-viet/).

### On the topic of dialects
So people may wonder something like "Does it actually matter which dialect I'll learn between Southern and Northern vietnamese?". TL;DR: *Do you have problems understanding American and British English? That should be your answer.*

Here is another answer by [u/Particular-Live](https://reddit.com/user/Particular-Live) on [this post](https://reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1de83v4/deleted_by_user/):

> I'm from the South, but I can understand Northern dialects just fine.
>
> In my experience, Northerners and Southerners generally understand each other well, though we do have occasional miscommunications.
>
> For example, in the North, "củ sắn" (manioc) is what we in the South call "khoai mì," while Northerners refer to "củ sắn" (in Southern) as "củ đậu" (bean roots).
>
> The hardest accent for most people to understand is probably from the central region, particularly Nghe An.
>
> Regardless of how we pronounce words, we have only one way of writing, so I can always just ask them to write it down.

### Which dialect is more common on the internet?

You'll encounter both dialects on the Internet. It's not too hard to learn dialect-specific words - your real problem will be understanding Vietnamese written without accent marks, Vietnamese with typos, teen code (our version of leetspeak), slangs and memes.

### Avoid toxic arguments regarding study methods

While there is such a thing as a best method for an individual, that doesn't mean it's best for everyone. Some people prefer textbooks, some might enjoy watching Vietnamese movies. This method mentioned in this site worked for me and learners that I've encountered.

### Should I get Vietnamese classes or a tutor?

If you'd like to, but it's not necessary by any means.
