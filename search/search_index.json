This is input that is understandable at your level, where there\u2019s just a few missing pieces of the puzzle every few sentences. With this sort of immersion, you subconsciously fill in the incomprehensible parts with educated guesses based on context, which is what makes this type of input so useful for the purposes of language learning.</p> <p>Now you may have noticed a problem here. What do you do if you don\u2019t have access to comprehensible input? As a complete beginner, there is no content that is easy. In fact, this is why people often fall into the endless cycle of reading from beginner resource to beginner resource. Though incomprehensible input is by no means useless\u2014it does have its benefits and assists with learning\u2014it is very difficult to get past that initial hurdle.</p> <p>Failing to understand the content you want to enjoy inherently sucks unless you take a specific mindset to it\u2014taking pleasure in the knowledge that you are making gradual progress, even if that progress is immediately imperceptible. However, it\u2019s difficult to maintain this mindset all the time, so it isn\u2019t reliable as the sole motivator for consistency\u2014the number one key of mastering any skill!</p> <p>So how can we make it so we don\u2019t constantly dread having to parse through content that is difficult to understand?</p> <p>The answer is actually very simple. Fun! Media can be entertaining for reasons other than language content. By choosing media that also has high entertainment value regardless of its language level, we are able to stay consistently engaged and motivated to continue our immersion. Then, as our language experience grows, we naturally find ourselves understanding more and more, and the once seemingly unattainable goal of finding comprehensible input has now become a given, with the goal rather shifting to finding content that is difficult enough to push us to continue learning.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#17-how-to-immerse","title":"1.7 How to immerse","text":""},{"location":"guide/#reading-dictionaries","title":"Reading &amp; Dictionaries","text":"<p>To make Vietnamese less of a pain to read, you can use a free browser extension known as Yomitan.

We don't want to think too hard over things when we are listening. Go with the flow until you find a really good oppportunity to pause and look something up. There are certain levels to listening. Level one would be free-flow listening, where you let the listening flow without looking things up. Level two would be looking things up that pop out at you but still letting the listening play. Level three would be pausing at every single unknown word and looking them up. In the beginner to intermediate stages, listening is entirely level one and level two listening.

While output won't directly improve your proficiency at the language, it is still quite important to be practicing output, whether it is by texting or with speech, because input and output go hand in hand. Doing output effectively forces your brain to make sure it is correctly understanding the words you are hearing and you may start to subconsciously look for opportunities to use what you hear in input. Regular output along with regular input is recommended.</p> <p>Contrary to what many immersion-based learning methods say, I do not believe it is a smart idea to delay your output until you are \"really good\" for reasons such as \"saying things incorrectly is going to \"cripple\" or \"ruin\" your Vietnamese\". Doing this makes you miss out on so many opportunities to pick up on things to use in your output earlier and brainwashes you into a toxic perfectionist mindset, becoming extremely protective of your Vietnamese.</p> <p>Throughout my 4+ years of running TheMoeWay and talking to all sorts of immersion learners, I haven't seen many that are confident in output. Why is that? Well for most of them, they don't even want to try outputting at all because they're scared of saying something broken, or scared that it's going to ruin their Japanese, or scared that somebody may laugh at them etc. All of this is a product of a toxic perfectionist mindset that hurts immersion learning (Most of the people in TheMoeWay community learn Japanese).</p>"},{"location":"guide/#32-pronunciation","title":"3.2 Pronunciation","text":"<p>Learning Vietnamese pronunciation is tough, even for advanced learners.
