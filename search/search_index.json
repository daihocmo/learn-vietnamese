You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence.  The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence.

What if I\u2019m English and I use the \"\" (Vietnamese-German bilingual dictionary)? Same thing. You will still have this problem. There is no language that can express Vietnamese better than Vietnamese itself.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#what-exactly-do-you-mean-by-false-associations","title":"What exactly do you mean by \u201cfalse associations\u201d?","text":"<p>Bilingual definitions, 90% of the time are very vague, and do not capture the true feeling of the word. You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions do not capture the true feel of the word.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an example: </p> <p>Th\u1ed1ng kh\u1ed5 </p> <p>If you have been learning Vietnamese for a few months, you would know this word. And chances are you learned it using a bilingual dictionary. Let\u2019s look at the bilingual definition.</p> <p>unhappy, miserable  </p> <p>You may think, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition.</p> <p>Taken from the T\u1eeb \u0111i\u1ec3n Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t th\u00f4ng d\u1ee5ng</p> <p>\u0110au \u0111\u1edbn v\u00e0 kh\u1ed5 s\u1edf \u0111\u1ebfn c\u1ef1c \u0111\u1ed9</p> <p>My translation of the definition:</p> <p>Feel painful and extremely miserable</p> <p>And this gets less accurate when you put it into English.</p> <p>Did you get that from unhappy, miserable? No. Probably not.</p> <p>Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example.</p> <p>X\u1ea5u</p> <p>Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d.</p> <p>You can't use x\u1ea5u to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Vietnamese, and that\u2019s k\u00e9m (or t\u1ed3i, d\u1edf). See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem.</p> <p>The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Vietnamese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Vietnamese as well as Vietnamese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Vietnamese-English bilingual dictionary then you will have a \"d\u1ecb\" way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually.</p> <p>Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-people-find-it-hard-to-go-monolingual","title":"Why people find it hard to go monolingual.","text":"<p>Two reasons:  </p> <ul> <li>They don\u2019t know the words.  </li> <li>Are not used to the written Vietnamese.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"monolingual/#monolingual-transition-myths","title":"Monolingual transition myths","text":"<ul> <li>A profound belief that \"dictionary vocabulary\" exist. </li> </ul> <p>The truth: \u201cDictionary vocabulary\u201d = words you don\u2019t know because you don\u2019t read enough.</p>"},{"location":"monolingual/#yomichan-the-better-way-to-go-monolingual","title":"Yomichan - the better way to go monolingual.","text":"<p>I recommend doing the monolingual transition with Yomichan. </p> <p></p> <p>Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Vietnamese words on a webpage by holding Shift and hovering over it.

Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier).  </p> <p>The flowchart process:</p> <ol> <li>Watch with English subtitles  </li> <li>Watch without any subtitles (also known as raw listening)  </li> <li>Are you done for today? <ul> <li>Yes = Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things.</li> <li>No = Go back to step 1.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input.  </p> <p>While watching the episode raw, don't worry if you can't understand.  </p> <p>Try to focus on the sounds, the speaking patterns and anything in it that you can make meaning out of.  </p> <p>Becoming able to understand Vietnamese is a skill that takes a long time.  </p> <p>But it all begins with raw listening and trying to make that listening comprehensible.  </p> <p>The subtitle tutor method is only meant to provide context for the audio you are listening to.   </p> <p>You can try listening to the audio when doing other things.  </p> <p>By doing that you are essentially filling in the silence with Vietnamese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said.  </p> <p>Note: Listening while doing other things = passive immersion. Listening with undivided attention = active immersion.  </p> <p>Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study? </p> <p>A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of their environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Vietnamese and get a deeper feel for the language.  </p> <p>Q: So, I've completed my first episode, what should I do now?</p> <p>A: You can consider your immersion done for the day but if you want to do more (which is great) then you can roll a dice to decide how many episodes you want to watch.  </p> <p>Roll a dice </p> <p>I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow.  </p>"},{"location":"routine/#day-3","title":"Day 3","text":""},{"location":"routine/#stage-just-starting-grammar","title":"Stage: Just starting grammar","text":"<p>Now here's where you'll start grammar.  </p> <p>You don't need to do any drills or anything.    </p> <p>You don't need to choose the correct patterns or anything like that.   </p> <p>Everything you will be learning is insanely common and will be reinforced with your daily immersion.     </p> <p>The grammar guide I want you to use is seahorse viet grammar's archive</p> <p>All I want you to do is watch the videos and take notes</p> <p>(Google Keep note taking site here: https://keep.google.com/)  </p> <p>Take notes. </p> <p>Q: What should I even put in my notes? </p> <p>A: You should put information that you feel is important.  </p> <p>Rely on your instincts.  </p> <p>If they say this means that, then you might want to take a note of it.  </p> <p>Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone.  </p> <p>Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes.  </p> <p>Q: Why should I even do notes!

It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option.  </p> <p>Download the he Basic Vietnamese for English Speakers.</p> <p>When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the \"interface language selector\". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine.  </p> <p>Go into Tools on the top bar, and click Preferences (Ctrl+P).  </p> <p>In this window, click on the Scheduling tab, and check (\u2713) the option \"V3 Scheduler\".  </p> <p>And change the Learn ahead limit to <code>900</code>.  </p> <p>Now click Close.  </p> <p>In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button Import File is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck.  Once clicked, it should open the file picker window.   </p> <p>Choose your downloaded deck.  </p> <p>When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok.  </p> <p>Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it.  </p> <p>The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day.  </p> <p>20 cards is the default.  </p> <p>20 cards may or not be manageable.  </p> <p>You might want to lower the number of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now.   </p> <p>Click the cog icon next to the Kaishi 1.5k deck.  </p> <p>Click Options.  </p> <p>Change Maximum reviews/day to <code>9999</code>. This just means \"uncapped\".  </p> <p>The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki every day but,  </p> <p>It is good practice to uncap your review limit.  </p> <p>Just some Anki know-how.  </p> <p>You also need to change the Learning steps to <code>1m 5m 10m</code>.  </p> <p>Change Insertion order, to Sequential (oldest cards first) </p> <p>Under the Lapses section, change the Relearning Steps to <code>10m</code>.  </p> <p>Under the Display Order section, change the New/review order to Show before reviews.  </p> <p>Now click Save.  </p> <p>I also want you to install the Speed Focus Mode Anki add-on. I will explain why later, but let's just install it now.  </p> <p>Click on Tools at the top of Anki, and click Add-ons.  </p> <p>Click Get Add-ons....   </p> <p>Paste this code into the box: <code>1046608507</code> and click OK.</p> <p>You need to restart Anki. Close Anki, and launch it back up.  </p> <p>Click the cog icon next to the Kaishi 1.5k deck.  </p> <p>Hold the Shift key and click Options.  </p> <p>A different looking menu with some red text should open. (If it did not, you did it wrong. You need to hold Shift while clicking Options).  </p> <p>In the General tab, there are a few settings you need to change.  </p> <p>Change Automatically play alert to <code>15</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Change Automatically show answer to <code>30</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Change Automatically rate 'again' to <code>180</code> seconds.  </p> <p>Now let's get to studying the deck.  </p> <p>When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking Study now </p> <p>If you click \"Show answer\", it reveals the back of the card, and you will be able to find out how to read the word on the front.  </p> <p>The deck has other features, such as word meaning, audio, sentence and translations.  </p> <p>BUT the only things you should be memorising is the word on the front, reading and word meaning.</p> <p>Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else.  </p> <p>Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. </p> <p>In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself.   </p> <p>Think of Again as \"I GOT IT WRONG\". Easy as SUPER EASY, Good as normal/usual/eh, and Hard as \"I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right\".  </p> <p>Because this is a card that is seen for the first time, press \"Again\".  </p> <p>When seeing \"unseen cards\" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing Again.  </p> <p>This will send the card to the \"Learning\" pile. </p> <p>You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1?  </p> <p>The red number is the learning pile.  </p> <p>Blue: New pile Red: Learning pile Green: Review pile  </p> <p>The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. </p> <p>Getting a \"Good\" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in x number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards).  </p> <p>When the learning pile (red number) goes down that means the card has graduated.  </p> <p>Do not spend a long time looking at the same card </p> <p>When you don't know the word even after 15 seconds of looking at it, then looking at it for even longer doesn't mean you'll suddenly remember it.  </p> <p>So, the purpose of the Speed Focus Mode add-on is to stop you from spending too much time on one card.  </p> <p>My card learning method </p> <p>Step 1: Look at the card. Step 2: Recognize whether it is a new card or not. Step 3: Reveal the back (Show answer) after realizing it is a new card. Step 4: Read the reading. Step 5: Read the meaning. Step 6: Let the audio play. Step 7: For now, press \"Again\" Step 8: Above 7 steps will be the same if the next card is also a new card but... Step 9: If the next card is one I've already seen before, I test my knowledge. Step 10: I try to recall the word's meaning and the reading. Step 11: There are sometimes more than 1 meaning. Only 1 meaning is enough. Step 12: I reveal the back. Step 13: I grade myself depending on if the meaning and reading I thought it was, was correct. Step 14: I usually use the Good button if I got it correct. Again if it wasn't correct.  </p> <p>After you have successfully learned 20 cards, you can consider your Anki done for the day.  </p> <p>The next day you can expect to see some cards in the green (Review) pile. </p> <p>You will also have a fresh batch of 20 new cards!  </p> <p>Please make sure you do Anki every day!   </p> <p>Q: Should I worry if I forget a lot? </p> <p>A: No.  </p> <p>Anki is made for things you're likely to forget.  </p> <p>You are very likely to forget words of a language you just started learning.  </p> <p>I don't think it is strange if you forget more than half of what you learn when a day passes by.  </p> <p>You're likely to forget these words without Anki, so that's why you need to keep Anki'ing them so you can finally learn the word.  </p> <p>In other words, just keep doing Anki.  </p> <p>If this continues for a while then you might want to think back on your method of doing Anki.   </p> <p>Q: Leeches (Words not sticking) </p> <p>Leeches are when you keep forgetting the word no matter what.  </p> <p>Memory works by picking up on cues.  </p> <p>When words don't stick, it means there are multiple things in the wider scope of the word that makes it so your mind isn't picking on any cues. </p> <p>In easier terms, you need more, or different information than the information on the card.  </p> <p>For these leeches, I recommend looking at them in example sentences. You can use tratu.coviet.vn to see example sentences with an English translation.  </p> <p>Setting up a Vietnamese Keyboard </p> <p>Now let's set up a Vietnamese keyboard. </p> <p>Read this article: How to type Vietnamese on Computers </p> <p>Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion.  </p> <p>I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing.  </p> <p>I recommend you decide on a set number of episodes to use for immersion per day.

It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember.  </p> <p>In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now.  </p> <p>Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time.  </p> <p>What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like \"Oh, right!\". And move on.  </p> <p>Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Vietnamese has no spaces! </p> <p>A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner.  </p> <p>You get better at it over time.  </p> <p>Language learning is just pattern recognition after all.  </p> <p>Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy.  </p> <p>Q: Now that I can see the Vietnamese, can I try to translate it in my head? </p> <p>A: It's complicated...   </p> <p>There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Vietnamese.  </p> <p>The way of thinking is a lot different.  </p> <p>That is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tends to advise against trying to translate your immersion.  </p> <p>Because Vietnamese is not English.  </p> <p>You are advised to think of Vietnamese as Vietnamese.  </p> <p>Be the language!  </p> <p>You can do some sort of \"loose translation\", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning.  </p> <p>Do I need to translate at all? </p> <p>Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (Missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning that's hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.)  </p> <p>It is also tiring, so do it in moderation.  </p> <p>Q: Should I watch Vietnamese subs or raw? </p> <p>A: They exist for different purposes.  </p> <p>I can't say which one is better because they have their own benefits and drawbacks.  </p> <p>Vietnamese subs:  Good: learn new words, reading practice Bad: doesn't train raw listening ability, you might not pick up on things said in the audio  </p> <p>Raw: Good: trains raw listening ability and can attribute to speaking ability too. You will notice more than just watching with Vietnamese subtitles. Bad: the words you dont know you just don't know.  </p> <p>Q: What about subtitle tutor? </p> <p>A: You shouldn't be doing it all the time.  </p> <p>The only purpose is to give you an idea; context of what the audio is saying.  </p> <p>It gets tedious watching the same episode twice too.</p> <p>Without watching the episode in Vietnamese after you watch it in English, there is no point.  </p> <p>And using English subs as a crutch forever isn't a good idea.  </p> <p>It just makes your immersion more effective in the beginning because immersion works better when you have an idea of what is going on.  </p> <p>Getting rid of translations and training yourself to understand the language on its own is how you'll get better at Vietnamese in the future.  </p>"},{"location":"routine/#day-7","title":"Day 7","text":"<p>Note about alphabet practice: </p> <p>Experience differs greatly from person to person. </p> <p>Some of you may already be comfortable with the alphabet after just 6 days.  </p> <p>Others may need more practice.  </p> <p>I think you should reduce the time spent on alphabet practice from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.  </p> <p>You will be exposed to Vietnamese text a lot more going forward.  </p>"},{"location":"routine/#stage-learning-how-to-balance-as-a-beginner","title":"Stage: Learning how to balance as a beginner.","text":"<p>Your tasks for today are as follows.  </p> <p>Step 1.

Output is just the icing on the cake.</p> <p>When it comes to learning a foreign language, we usually think, \u201cOh if I speak it a lot, I will get good!\u201d. Unfortunately, this is in fact false. Immersion (input) is how you get good at Vietnamese. In other words, listening and reading native content in Vietnamese. Natural phrasing comes with thousands of hours of input (specifically listening!). But you still have a \u201cceiling\u201d you need to reach, you can do that with speaking practice. You need to input so that you already know what\u2019s correct before speaking, because you have heard it in your input, so you will know exactly what natural thing to say before you have a conversation. With more input, your output ceiling rises, meaning you have higher output capacity. So speaking as a total beginner is pointless, your output ceiling is extremely low, so no amount of speaking practice can help you improve speaking. With a couple hundred hours more of input, your output ceiling will rise. Then you can practice speaking to hit your ceiling. You may know when you\u2019ve hit your ceiling when you try to say something but don\u2019t know how to express it naturally so you resort to translating from English to Vietnamese in your head using the grammar structures you memorized. When this happens it is clear you need more input. In other words if you can't think of how to express your thoughts, you need more input. After you feel confident again, you can go back to outputting.</p> <p>Another reason why it is bad to output early is that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and a native speaker won\u2019t inform you. So you could be making big mistakes but not realising.

This is because it is to ensure you get a good accent in the end. The reason why you should listen to Vietnamese first is to build a model of how Vietnamese sounds in your head, to get you used to how Vietnamese sounds. If you read without this knowledge, you may end up speaking with a foreign accent. Foreign accents happen when you think a sound in the target language is the same as a similar sounding sound in your native because you haven't listened long enough. It is almost impossible to read a language without applying any phonetic component to it, so even if you read in your head, you may still get this problem. Of course, if you don't care about accent, and would be fine with a \"ngo\u1ea1i qu\u1ed1c\" accent, then you don't really need to listen. Methods of approaching Vietnamese are never one-size-fits-all. But, I think it will really hurt your ego if you can read \"v\u0103n b\u1ea3n h\u00e0nh ch\u00ednh\" but can't understand any casual conversations and you may not be motivated to start mass listening late.
