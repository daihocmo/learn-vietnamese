This is input that is understandable at your level, where there\u2019s just a few missing pieces of the puzzle every few sentences. With this sort of immersion, you subconsciously fill in the incomprehensible parts with educated guesses based on context, which is what makes this type of input so useful for the purposes of language learning.</p> <p>Now you may have noticed a problem here. What do you do if you don\u2019t have access to comprehensible input? As a complete beginner, there is no content that is easy. In fact, this is why people often fall into the endless cycle of reading from beginner resource to beginner resource. Though incomprehensible input is by no means useless\u2014it does have its benefits and assists with learning\u2014it is very difficult to get past that initial hurdle.</p> <p>Failing to understand the content you want to enjoy inherently sucks unless you take a specific mindset to it\u2014taking pleasure in the knowledge that you are making gradual progress, even if that progress is immediately imperceptible.

Fun! Media can be entertaining for reasons other than language content. By choosing media that also has high entertainment value regardless of its language level, we are able to stay consistently engaged and motivated to continue our immersion. Then, as our language experience grows, we naturally find ourselves understanding more and more, and the once seemingly unattainable goal of finding comprehensible input has now become a given, with the goal rather shifting to finding content that is difficult enough to push us to continue learning.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#17-how-to-immerse","title":"1.7 How to immerse","text":""},{"location":"guide/#reading-dictionaries","title":"Reading &amp; Dictionaries","text":"<p>To make Vietnamese less of a pain to read, you can use a free browser extension known as Yomitan.

While output won't directly improve your proficiency at the language, it is still quite important to be practicing output, whether it is by texting or with speech, because input and output go hand in hand. Doing output effectively forces your brain to make sure it is correctly understanding the words you are hearing and you may start to subconsciously look for opportunities to use what you hear in input. Regular output along with regular input is recommended.</p> <p>Contrary to what many immersion-based learning methods say, I do not believe it is a smart idea to delay your output until you are \"really good\" for reasons such as \"saying things incorrectly is going to \"cripple\" or \"ruin\" your Vietnamese\".

Simply put, incomprehensible inputs is better than nothing but it's practically useless. Comprehensible inputs will teach you language nuisances, new vocabs, solidified previously learned concepts, language intuitions(grammar), .etc.</p> <p>It has a very important part that people gloss over. In order to be useful, the input must be over 90% comprehensible to the one receiving the input and the learner generally has to receive input on the same word/grammar nearly a dozen times for it to actually embed itself. It's not comprehensible input unless you can understand it. That is what \"comprehensible\" means. </p> <p>If the input contains too many things the learner cannot figure out, it is no longer comprehensible. If you're reading or listening to something and only understand a few words, it's not comprehensible.

At least, not in the beginning. As a beginner, an hour spent reading a textbook will give you about a hundred times more bang for your buck than an hour spent watching a TV-show. A few months in textbooks and other learning materials will slowly stop giving those massive returns in investment and immersion will gradually take its place as the main source of learning, but the nature of the beast is that the more of the language you know the easier it gets to learn even more. The corollary to this is that the less of a language you know the harder it will be to learn more. And since in the beginning you know nothing at all, you gotta do at least some studying. A textbook will straight-up tell you \"This word means that thing. That grammar point means this thing\". In the beginning you will need that.</p> <p>Research on both babies and adult second language learners suggests that we don't learn language just by hearing it. (Hearing babies of deaf parents don't learn language from TV!). We need to hear it at a level that is deliberately slowed down and simplified so that we can understand it.

It's part of the prescription, joined with many other things. I'm not sure how comprehensible input could work for someone trying to self-study unless you're following a plan made by someone else.

It's 1 of the main cultures within the\u00a0East Asian cultural sphere, and even\u00a0Harvard\u00a0labels Vietnamese as East Asian. Also, Vietnamese used to be written in\u00a0Chinese characters\u00a0before the French came and changed everything, and our ancestors came from South China &amp; North Vietnam</p> <p>Compare to other East Asian cultures (China, Japan, Korea), You can say that Vietnamese are somewhat more genuine and open to other cultures. Us Vietnamese live among a lots of culture and they (for whom I have seen) mostly do not regard toward races and genders much. Vietnamese are also (again, for the people I have seen) hard working and trying to figure their way around a lot. A lot of poor, underprivileged Vietnamese find happiness in themselves. And they would help people in need whenever their condition allows it.</p> <p>This maybe bright and optimistic since this is what I see through my lens. Maybe I am a lucky person to have been able to engage with such people. But it never hurts too badly if you have faith and belief in people.</p> <p>How would you describe the Vietnamese culture?</p> <p>Initially, I would like to say that this question is very interesting. In terms of influence, generally, the Vietnamese culture is mainly influenced by two other cultures: the Chinese and the Western.</p> <p>Because of geography, the Vietnamese culture is influenced by the Chinese one very, very remarkably. I could assert that the Chinese characteristics in it are more intensive than in Korean or Japanese cultures. Vietnam had been controlled by the Chinese monarchs in more than one thousand years. And even though Vietnam became independent from the 10th century, Vietnamese still realized the strong Chinese influence in their lives. Thus, it is unsurprising when Vietnam is considered as a part of the East Asian cultural sphere or the Sinitic culture.</p> <p></p> <p>However, from the 19th century, Vietnam began receiving Western cultural influences when the French armies took invasions of Vietnam. When Vietnam was completely a French colony, Western culture started an influx into Vietnam, mainly the French one. This influx was such strong that many Chinese signs were erased. Then, in the Vietnam War, by the appearance of Americans, Vietnam received American cultural impacts. And up to today, in globalization, Vietnamese culture is impacted by many cultures, including the Western one.</p> <p>(Vietnam was a part of the French Indochina)</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to that, due to globalization, Vietnam is under the cultural effects of Korea (through the Hallyu movement) and Japan (through anime, manga, and more) as well as the other countries.</p> <p>In terms of characteristics, overall, because Vietnam is traditionally an agricultural nation, the Vietnamese culture demonstrates the cultural points. Furthermore, it has many other essential clues.</p> <p>Language: Vietnamese is a member of the Vietic, the branch of the Austroasiatic language, intelligible to the M\u01b0\u1eddng language. In history, Vietnamese people used Chinese characters to write their mother tongue. Then, from the 13th century, they invented \u201cCh\u1eef N\u00f4m\u201d to be independent linguistically. Both Chinese characters and \u201cCh\u1eef N\u00f4m\u201d were used until the 20th century as they were replaced by the \u201cQu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef\u201d. (The image below is a \u201cCh\u1eef N\u00f4m\u201d script of one of the most famous Vietnamese literature works \u201cTruy\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec1u\u201d, or \u201cThe Story of Ki\u1ec1u\u201d)</p> <p></p> <p>Cuisine: Vietnam is very rich in terms of cuisine. That is because the climate of this country supports the development of a multitude of animals and plants. Additionally. Vietnam has been the intersection of numerous cultures in the world. As a result, Vietnamese cuisine is very different. Some typical Vietnamese aliments are rice, \u201cph\u1edf\u201d, \u201cb\u00e1nh m\u00ec\u201d and \u201cb\u00fan ch\u1ea3\u201d (I hope someday you will visit Vietnam to eat them. They are delicious!). And unlike Westerners and like East Asians, Vietnamese use chopsticks in meals. (The image below is \u201cb\u00fan ch\u1ea3\u201d).</p> <p></p> <p>Costume: In history, Vietnamese costumes were strongly influenced by the Chinese ones. Thereafter, in Westernization, Vietnamese began wearing like Westerners. However, Vietnam has distinct clothes, representatively \u201c\u00e1o d\u00e0i\u201d. Vietnamese women become more beautiful when they wear it. (The image below is the traditional clothes for both Vietnamese men and women).</p> <p></p> <p>Architecture: When Vietnam was a monarchial nation, Vietnamese architecture was impacted by China. Still, unlike Chinese old architectural products, the Vietnamese ones were more moderate. This point could be also found in the majority of Vietnamese modern buildings, which are constructed in Western-style. (The image below is in Hu\u1ebf, the former capital of Vietnam in the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty).</p> <p></p> <p>Literature: It could be said that Vietnamese like writing poems and stories very, very much. In the monarchial period, poets and story writers were mainly officers. They wrote those products just for entertainment. As for structure, they used the Chinese structure. However, in the \u201cl\u1ee5c b\u00e1t\u201d poetry, they created a different structure (the first sentence includes six words, the second includes eight words). As for style, they were influenced remarkably by Chinese. As for topics, they were Chinese history (surprising, right?) and regular life as well as the personal mind. In the modern period, Vietnamese generally erase many Chinese clues to receive new ones from the West. Literature topics are richer than the past</p> <p>Music: Although not achieving successes like Western music, in history, Vietnamese music was very vibrant. Like other cultural aspects, this music illustrated Chinese influence. it descended pentatonic mind. Another essential point is royal music and common music was different. Royal music preferred dancing or performing without words, where common music preferred singing. The main topics were Chinese history and regular life In this period, Vietnamese music brings Western and Korean clues. Topics are more abundant than in past but focused on principally love. Some of the Vietnamese typical musical kinds are \u201ctu\u1ed3ng\u201d, \u201cch\u00e8o\u201d, \u201cc\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng\u201d, \u201cca tr\u00f9\u201d, \u201cnh\u00e3 nh\u1ea1c\u201d. (The image below is a \u201cca tr\u00f9\u201d performance).</p> <p></p> <p>Lifestyle: Vietnamese prefer living in a community or a group to living in isolation.</p> <p>Belief: Vietnamese believe there is another world for the dead people. Hence, in each Vietnamese home, there is an area or a room to obey and communicate with their ancestors. They also believe in the power of \u00d4ng Tr\u1eddi, as the Christians believe in Jesus Christ. Thus, the Vietnamese sentence \u201c\u00d4i tr\u1eddi \u01a1i!\u201d is similar to \u201cOh my God\u201d in English. Additionally, plenty of Vietnamese also believe in ideologies of some religions like Buddhism and Christianity. (The image below is an altar, obeying the ancestors of a Vietnamese family).</p> <p></p> <p>Religion: The majority of Vietnamese don\u2019t follow any religion. For the rest, according to the latest religious statistics, Vietnamese Christians are the most, followed by Vietnamese Buddhists. Vietnamese also created new regions like Cao \u0110\u00e0i or new religious branches like H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o Buddhism. (The image below is a meeting of the Cao \u0110\u00e0i followers).</p> <p></p> <p>Those are some characteristics of Vietnamese culture.</p>"},{"location":"yomi-setup/","title":"Yomitan","text":"<p>First, please visit this page to download Vietnamese - English Dictionary (VNEDICT) Yomitan dictionary.</p> <p></p> <p>Choose VNEDICT and it will redirect to the download page.
